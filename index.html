                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I have made my home base in Edmonton, Alberta for the past 15 years. Last year, my wife and I were blessed to each have babies and now we have three, amazing toddlers keeping us on our toes (in case you’re doing the math, this mama had twins)! <br> My journey into tech started with a diploma in Communications with a focus on Public Relations and Advertising. Over the past decade I have developed and honed my marketing skills within Edmonton’s real estate sector, during which time I outsourced much of the online technical work to consultants. Inspired by the minds and technical abilities of these consultants, I set out to learn how to code and develop my own technical skills!</p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>With excitement (and, if I’m being honest, a little fear), I quit my day job in June, 2017 and started studies in the new, exciting world of tech! After building my first website, I’ve realized I found something that not only compliments my strengths &amp; work-style but has given me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my career. I have since made a full switch to front-end developement, where I can use my organization, marketing skills and eye for detail to build websites that help build brands and grow businesses! </p>
